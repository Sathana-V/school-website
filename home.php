                <p>Dear Parents, We welcome you into our world at <mark style="background:none;color:yellow;">SVMH School</mark> Bangalore North, an institution that promotes meaningful and joyful learning, a school where scholastic and co-scholastic activities are closely interwoven into the curricular
                    fabric, a home away from home where students and teachers share a relationship of mutual trust, respect, warmth, and affection. A Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation system (CCE) caters to the holistic development of children integrating
                    sports, fine arts, yoga & martial arts, environmental awareness, values and attitudes, life skills and technology with scholastic subjects. Students’ assessment is based on 21st century skill development. An inclusive and progressive
                    school like SVMH Bangalore North lays strong emphasis on personalization, meeting diverse needs, providing equal opportunities for learning and maintaining high standards of achievement at all levels. The secure environment of SVMH Bangalore
                    North provides children with opportunities to learn, explore, play, discover their hidden talents and make informed choices. Schooling by nature is a social and cultural undertaking. As the world shrinks and barriers are broken, our
                    students join hands with their counterparts across the country & the world by working together on multiple areas. Through international exchange programmes, social responsibility initiatives, human rights issues, environment conservation
                    programmes, cultural exchange programmes and projects, they learn invaluable life lessons on diversity, equity, tolerance and acceptance. Empowered with a strong sense of wellbeing, we are confident that our students will emerge as
                    responsible global leaders and citizens with strong moral, ethical and social values.</p>
